After downloading Mongo, create the “db” directory. 
This is where the Mongo data files will live. You can create the directory in the default location by running sudo mkdir -p /data/db
Make sure that the /data/db directory has the right permissions by running.

> sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db
> # Enter your password
